    >>> assert c.exec_time_ms < 500

    and one in microseconds:
    >>> assert c.exec_time_us < 500000

    By default, the command runs without any environment variable. You can set them with the second argument:

    >>> c.stdout
    'Hello World!\\n'

    When `remove_color` is set to True, the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is defined to tell your command it should not output colors.
