    If you need to run the tests on both UNIX and Windows, it is recommended to set the `normalize_carriage_return` to True.
    This way, all the "\r\n" in standard output and standard error will be converted to "\n".
    **This will become the default behavior in version 2.0.**

    If the command returns a non-zero code, the successful property is false:
    >>> c = run(["python3", "-c", r"import sys; print('Oops, it didn\\'t work!', file=sys.stderr); exit(1)"], normalize_carriage_return=True)
    >>> c.successful
    False

    You can also check the execution time of your command thanks to three properties provided by the object:
    >>> assert c.exec_time_ms < 1000 # in millisecond
    >>> assert c.exec_time_us < 1000000 # in microseconds
    >>> assert c.exec_time_ns < 1000000000 # in nanoseconds

    You can get the text returned to the standard output and error:
    >>> c.stdout
    ''
    >>> c.stderr
    "Oops, it didn't work!\\n"

    By default, the command runs with the minimum environment variable required by the operating system (e.g. $PATH on UNIX).
    You can set new ones or overwrite the existing ones with the `environment` argument:
    >>> c = run(["env"], environment={"MY_VERY_COOL_ENV_VARIABLE": "Hello World!"}, normalize_carriage_return=True)
    >>> data = dict(entry.split("=") for entry in c.stdout.strip().split("\\n"))
    >>> data.get("LANG")
    'C'
    >>> data.get("MY_VERY_COOL_ENV_VARIABLE")
    'Hello World!'

    If the command returns colors, you can ask Aurornis to remove them automatically.
    >>> c = run(["python3", "-c", "print('\33[0;32mHello World!\33[0m')"], remove_colors=True, normalize_carriage_return=True)
    >>> c.stdout
    'Hello World!\\n'

    When `remove_color` is set to True, the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is defined to tell your command it should not output colors.
    It is recommended to take this environment variable in account, as it is becoming a standard.
    For more information, see https://no-color.org.

    If your command reads the standard input, you can give it with the `stdin` argument.
    It is a list of strings, which are joined with the end-of-line character ("\n") at execution.
    Remember that the text written in standard input does not appear in the standard output.
    >>> c = run(["python3", "-c", "who = input('Who are you? '); print(f'Hello {who}!')"], stdin=["World"], normalize_carriage_return=True)
    >>> c.successful
    True
    >>> c.stdout
    'Who are you? Hello World!\\n'

    The number of elements given in `stdin` is not verified by Aurornis, it is up to you to verify that the command
    has the expected behavior.
    >>> c = run(["python3", "-c", "who = input('Who are you? '); print(f'Hello {who}!')"], normalize_carriage_return=True)
    >>> c.successful
    False
    >>> c.stdout
    'Who are you? '
    >>> c.stderr
    'Traceback (most recent call last):\\n  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>\\nEOFError: EOF when reading a line\\n'
